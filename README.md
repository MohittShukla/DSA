## 🛠️ Installation & Usage  

### ✅ Prerequisites  
- A **C++ compiler** (G++, Clang, MSVC)  
- A **text editor or IDE** (VS Code, CLion, CodeBlocks)  

### 🔹 Compile & Run  
To compile a C++ file, use:  
```sh
g++ -o outputFile binaryTree/binarySearch.cpp
./outputFile
```

Alternatively, if you're using **Windows (MinGW)**:  
```sh
g++ -o outputFile.exe binaryTree/binarySearch.cpp
outputFile.exe
```

For **Mac/Linux** users:  
```sh
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -o outputFile graph/dijkstra.cpp
./outputFile
```
